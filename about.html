                      the articles. It is made of any type of rope, cord, wire, or twine that has been stretched between 
                      two points (e.g. two posts), outdoors or indoors, above ground level. Washing lines are attached either from
                       a post or a wall, and are frequently located in back gardens, or on balconies. Longer washing lines often have props
                        holding up the mid-section so the weight of the clothing does not pull the clothesline down to the ground.</p>
